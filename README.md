# 📊 Pandas and Matplotlib Data Analysis Assignment

This project demonstrates how to analyze a dataset using **Pandas** and visualize it using **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**. The classic Iris dataset is used for this analysis.

---

## ✅ Objectives

- Load and explore a dataset using **Pandas**.
- Perform basic data analysis and grouping.
- Create visualizations using **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**.
- Derive findings based on the data.

---

## 📁 Files

- `main.py` - The Python script containing all the code for data loading, exploration, analysis, and visualization.

---

## 🧪 Tools & Libraries Used

- Python 3.x
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn (for loading the Iris dataset)

---

## 📈 Visualizations Included

1. **Line Chart** – Shows petal length trend across samples.
2. **Bar Chart** – Compares average petal length across species.
3. **Histogram** – Shows distribution of sepal width.
4. **Scatter Plot** – Visualizes the relationship between sepal length and petal length.

---

## 🔍 Key Findings

- Petal length increases significantly in the *versicolor* and *virginica* species.
- *Setosa* has the smallest average petal length.
- Sepal width is normally distributed but slightly left-skewed.
- There's a strong positive correlation between petal length and sepal length.
